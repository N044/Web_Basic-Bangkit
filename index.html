            I was born, grew up, and studied in Medan. Medan is the city that
            became the place where I grew up and became who I am today. Medan is
            a city that has many uniqueness and beauty. Medan is a city that has
            many interesting tourist attractions to visit. Medan becomes a
            witness to my happiness and sadness. Many stories happened in this

          <p>
            Medan comes from the Tamil word Maidhan or Maidhanam, which means a
            wide field or place, which was later adopted into Malay. In the
            Indonesian-Karo Dictionary (2002) written by Darwin Prinst, the word
            'terrain' means 'be healthy' or 'better.
